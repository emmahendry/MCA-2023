  <h1> Week 10: Audio Similarity and Transcription</h1>
  <h2> Task 2: Transcription</h2>

  <h3> Orignal Score Transcription</h3>

<p> This week’s task was to export our MuseScore file from week 2 into a WAV file and an image file. It was then to be transcribed as according to the tasks from the week 10 group lab. After opening the MIDI file in MuseScore it was clear to see that a difference in the two scores was evident. </p>

  <p> In comparison to the originally created score, visually the two renditions are extremely different in presentation. Within week 10 the score has been altered drastically after the tasks laid out in this week’s course had been completed. Showing drastic alterations and excessive musical notation differing from the original. Despite this, there remains portions of the score which sonically sound comparable to the original piece. </p>

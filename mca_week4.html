  <h2> Task 1: Generating a Pitch Histogram and a Piano Roll</h2>

  <h3> Pitch Histogram</h3>

  <p> A pitch histogram is designed to showcase the numerical data associated with how many times musical notes are played throughout songs. This particular graph shows the "Octave" along Y-Axis and the "Count" along the X-Axis. The highest number of times a single note has been used throughout this song is 20 times and the lowest being 1 single use of a note.</p>

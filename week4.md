# *Week 4* #

## *Generating a Pitch Histogram and a Piano Roll* #

 ### *Pitch Histogram* ###

 *A pitch histogram is designed to showcase the numerical data associated with how many times musical notes are played throughout songs. This particular graph shows the "Octave" along Y-Axis and the "Count" along the X-Axis. The highest number of times a single note has been used throughout this song is 20 times and the lowest being 1 single use of a note.*

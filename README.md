# Week 1: Basics of Music Data
## *Task 1: Identify a Theme* #
*The theme which I have decided to investigate for this Music Curation and Analysis assignment is centered on “The Arctic Monkeys”. This band remains one of the most notable groups to emerge from the early 2000s, with 6 Grammy nominations to their name. I have chosen the album “Favorite worst nightmare” which was released in 2007 which went No.1 in the UK. This album is widely renowned for being one of their most successful albums. Throughout this project I will be focusing on the use of electric guitar for the tasks relating to notated data (musical scores). I have decided to focus closely on arguably, one of their most popular songs to come from this album “505”. My interest in this band is due to their notable impact across the last two decades along with being a fan of their music.*

## *Musical Scores*

*Through my investigating I managed to find sheet music for the song ”505” which concentrated on providing musical scores for the electric guitar. During my investigating I looked at many other websites designed for the sharing of musical scores like MuseScore and found like many others these websites tended to be paywalled in some way.*  

## *Acoustic Data*

*When looking for audio recordings of this album ("Favourite Worst Nightmare"), I found that the best place to look for audio representation was on the website Internet Archive. By using this website I was able to obtain audio for the completed album, including "505". Audio recording's can also be found on every major music streaming service. Along with this recordings, music videos, fan covers and other related media can be found on YouTube.*

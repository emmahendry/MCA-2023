# Week 1: Basics of Music Data
## *Task 1: Identify a Theme* #
*5 Seconds of Summer are a pop-punk band originating from Sydney, Australia. The band originally rose to fame due to a plethora of cover songs posted on their YouTube channel. Currently with 6 albums in their discography there is an apparent genre shift between the group’s older music (which I have chosen to focus on) and their current sound. The band has made a clear shift away from pop-punk and has chosen to follow the route of pop-rock and new wave. I have chosen to focus on the more formative years of the band’s discography which is the earlier years of the career which gave us albums such as “Sounds Good Feels Good” and “5 Seconds of Summer”. I believe this album showcases what made them stand out from bands with similar styles in the 2010s, giving us songs such as “English Lover Affair” and “She Looks So Perfect” (arguably on of their most popular songs to this day).* 


*The theme which I have decided to investigate for this Music Curation and Analysis assignment is concentrated on “5 Seconds of Summer”. This band is one of the most notable groups to emerge from the 2010s, with multiple Grammy nominations to their name. I have chosen their self-titled album “5 Seconds of Summer”, released in 2014 which went No.1 in the 11 countries. It is widely renowned for being one of their most successful albums. I have decided to focus closely on arguably, one of their most popular songs to come from this album “Amnesia”. Throughout this project I will be focusing on a piano version for the tasks relating to notated data (musical scores). My interest in this topic is due to their notable impact across the last decade in the pop-punk scene, along with being a fan of their music for many years and the personal impact which their work has had on my music taste.*

## *Week 1:*

## *Musical Scores*

*Through my investigating I managed to find sheet music for the song ”Amnesia” which concentrated on providing musical scores for the piano. My original plan was to focus on electric guitar but I found after converting the sheet music to a MuseScore file it proved to be difficult understand. During my investigating I looked at many other websites designed for the sharing of musical scores such as MuseScore and found like many others these websites tended to be paywalled in some way or another, leading to the piano version of this song being the easiest to find.*  

## *Acoustic Data*

*When looking for audio recordings of this album ("5 Seconds of Summer"), I found that the best place to look for audio representation was on the website Internet Archive. By using this website I was able to obtain audio for the completed album, including "Amnesia". Audio recording's can also be found on every major music streaming service. Along with this recordings, music videos, fan covers and other related media can be found on YouTube.*

## *Metadata*

*An interesting place to look for data surrounding 5 Seconds of Summer is their own website. This website provides links to all social media platforms used by the band and where to listen to their music (Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube). There is a page dedicated to their current live shows (dates, locations, etc), along with a page for the bands music videos and song visualisers. Their latest album is on the front page of the website along with a sign up form to their mailing list. By following one of the multiple links to the music streaming platforms listeners will be provided with data such as track names, albums, genres, producers, copyright, album artwork and track durations.* 

## *Challenges*

*Challenges which I encountered during my investigation mainly were surrounding the issue of finding full audio recordings for the songs, I found most websites I invesigated only had partial recordings lasting around 30 seconds. I believe this is due to copyright issues but it did cause me to run into more issues during my data collection period. Along with this it proved difficult to find musical scores which were not fan made.*

# Week 1: Basics of Music Data
## *Task 1: Identify a Theme* #
*The theme which I have decided to investigate for this Music Curation and Analysis assignment is centered on “The Arctic Monkeys”. This band remains one of the most notable groups to emerge from the early 2000s, with 6 Grammy nominations to their name. I have chosen the album “AM” which was released in 2013 which went No.1 in the UK. This album is widely renowned for being one of their most successful albums. Throughout this project I will be focusing on a piano version for the tasks relating to notated data (musical scores). I have decided to focus closely on arguably, one of their most popular songs to come from this album “Do I Wanna Know”. My interest in this band is due to their notable impact across the last two decades along with being a fan of their music.*

## *Musical Scores*

*Through my investigating I managed to find sheet music for the song ”Do I wanna Know” which concentrated on providing musical scores for the piano. My original plan was to focus on electric guitar but I found after converting the sheet music to a MuseScore file it proved to be difficult understand. During my investigating I looked at many other websites designed for the sharing of musical scores such as MuseScore and found like many others these websites tended to be paywalled in some way or another, leading to the piano version of this song being the easiest to find.*  

## *Acoustic Data*

*When looking for audio recordings of this album ("AM"), I found that the best place to look for audio representation was on the website Internet Archive. By using this website I was able to obtain audio for the completed album, including "Do I Wanna Know". Audio recording's can also be found on every major music streaming service. Along with this recordings, music videos, fan covers and other related media can be found on YouTube.*

## *Metadata*

*An interesting place to look for data surrounding The Arctic Monkeys is their own website. This website provides links to all social media platforms used by the band and where to listen to their music (Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube). There is a page dedicated to their current live shows (dates, locations, etc), along with a page for the bands music videos. Their latest album is on the front page of the website along with a sign up form to their mailing list. By following one of the multiple links to the music streaming platforms listeners will be provided with data such as track names, albums, genres, producers, copyright, album artwork and track durations.* 

## *Challenges*

*Challenges which I encountered during my investigation mainly were surrounding the issue of finding full audio recordings for the songs, I found most websites I invesigated only had partial recordings lasting around 30 seconds. I believe this is due to copyright issues but it did cause me to run into more issues during my data collection period. Along with this it proved difficult to find musical scores which were not fan made.*

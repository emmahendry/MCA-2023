# MuseScore: Transcribing Muscial Scores
## *Task 1: Identifying a Musical Score* #

As previously discussed I am focusing on the song "Amnesia" by 5 Seconds of Summer, A song featured on their self titled album. When trying to located a musical score it proved difficult to find one which was not hidden behind a pay wall. It also became apparent that many sites which claimed to have "free" musical scores were not trustworthy sources for downloading pdfs from. I did however, locate a website which included the score I was searching for. The score is a piano version of the song "Amensia', found on the website:
https://sheetmusic-free.com/amnesia-sheet-music-5-seconds-of-summer/ , this website focuses on providing users with access to free musical scores.

When converting this score into MuseScore some of the issues I encountered were:
- Multiple uneeded bars being added into the score which resulted in a very time consuming process to try fix these mistakes whilst trying to maintain the integrity of the piece.
- When transcribing the score I also ran into the issue of trying to recreate the beams between musical notes in the orignal pdf.
- Many notes also seemed to be flipped or on different pitches. This again proved to be a very time consuming process to correct.

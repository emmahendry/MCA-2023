  <h1> Week 2: Transcribing Musical Scores </h1>
  <h2> Task 1: Identify a Musical Score</h2>

  <p> As previously discussed I am focusing on the song "Amnesia" by 5 Seconds of Summer, A song featured on their self titled album. When trying to located a musical score it proved difficult to find one which was not hidden behind a pay wall. It also became apparent that many sites which claimed to have "free" musical scores were not trustworthy sources for downloading pdfs from. I did however, locate a website which included the score I was searching for. The score is a piano version of the song "Amensia', found on a website which is heavily focused on providing users with access to free musical scores.</p>

</p>

<h3> When converting this score into MuseScore some of the issues I encountered were:</h3>

<li> Multiple uneeded bars being added into the score which resulted in a very time consuming process to try fix these mistakes whilst trying to maintain the integrity of the piece. </li>

<li> When transcribing the score I also ran into the issue of trying to recreate the beams between musical notes in the orignal pdf. </li>

<li> Many notes also seemed to be flipped or on different pitches. This again proved to be a very time consuming process to correct.</li>

<p> The theme which I have decided to investigate for this Music Curation and Analysis assignment is concentrated on “5 Seconds of Summer”. This band is one of the most notable groups to emerge from the 2010s pop-punk scene, with multiple Grammy nominations to their name. I have chosen their self-titled album “5 Seconds of Summer”, released in 2014 which went No.1 in the 11 countries. It is widely renowned for being one of their most successful albums. I have decided to focus closely on arguably, one of their most popular songs to come from this album “Amnesia”. Throughout this project I will be focusing on a piano version for the tasks relating to notated data (musical scores). My interest in this topic is due to their notable impact across the last decade in the pop-punk scene, along with being a fan of their music for many years and the personal impact which their work has had on my music taste.</p>



<h1> Task 1: </h1>

<h2> Musical Scores</h2>
<p> Through my investigating I managed to find sheet music for the song ”Amnesia” which concentrated on providing musical scores for the piano. My original plan was to focus on electric guitar but I found after converting the sheet music to a MuseScore file it proved to be difficult understand. During my investigating I looked at many other websites designed for the sharing of musical scores such as MuseScore and found like many others these websites tended to be paywalled in some way or another, leading to the piano version of this song being the easiest to find.</p>

<h2> Acoustic Data</h2>

<p>When looking for audio recordings of this album ("5 Seconds of Summer"), I found that the best place to look for audio representation was on the website Fandom Wiki. By using this website I was able to obtain audio for the completed song. Audio recording's can also be found on every major music streaming service. Along with this recordings, music videos, fan covers and other related media can be found on YouTube (as linked below). </p>
